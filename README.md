## Overview
SoulNet is a modern, full-stack social media application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js/Next.js, and Node.js) to provide users with a secure and interactive platform for digital communication. The application features user authentication (JWT-based), profile management, multimedia post creation, real-time likes/comments, follow/unfollow functionality, and personalized feeds, all wrapped in a responsive UI optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. Designed to address privacy concerns and algorithmic biases of existing platforms, SoulNet emphasizes scalability, data security (HTTPS, hashed passwords), and user-centric design. Future enhancements include real-time messaging, stories, and AI-driven recommendations, positioning it as a versatile foundation for community building and content sharing.
