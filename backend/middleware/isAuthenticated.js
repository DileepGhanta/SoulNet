//The main aim of this code is to verify if a user is
// authenticated by checking the validity of their JWT token and then attaching the user's 
//details to the req.user object. If the token is invalid or the user doesn't exist, it responds with an error.


// Exactly Ajay! ðŸ”¥ You're on point! Here's your code's goal in one crispy line:

// âœ… This code checks if a JWT token exists and is valid. If yes, it gets the user from DB and attaches it to req.user; else, it throws an auth error.

//JWT vundha? â†’ valid aa? â†’ user DB lo vunnara? â†’ then allow. Else, reject.
